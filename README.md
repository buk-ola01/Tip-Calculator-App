## My process

-    Semantic HTML5 markup
-    CSS custom properties
-    Flexbox
-    CSS Grid
-    Vanilla JS

### What I learned

-    Learnt how to use .forEach() function

```js
const array = [a, r, r, a, y];
array.forEach((item) => {
     return item * 2;
});
```

-    Learnt how to clear the arrow in <input type="number">

```css
input::-webkit-inner-spin-button,
input::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
     appearance: none;
     -webkit-appearance: none;
     -moz-appearance: none;
}
```

-    Learnt some form validation using Javascript

### Continued development

Looking forward to expand this later in the future

### Useful resources
